# Amplify Grocery List

Amplify Grocery List project is the sample application that is created for teaching people about Amplify Flutter Developer Preview libraries over this [blog post.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/announcing-flutter-web-and-desktop-support-for-aws-amplify-storage-analytics-and-api-libraries/)

![Preview of the project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salihgueler/amplify_grocery_list/cubit_version/assets/preview.gif)

## Running the project

This section explains how you can run the project.

### Requirements

- Flutter 3.0 or higher with proper Flutter setup
- An AWS Account
- Amplify CLI setup
- Check out the [guide](https://medium.com/flutter-community/mastering-aws-amplifys-sms-flows-in-flutter-part-1-aws-setup-ef748798fdbf) I created for you for setting it up.

### Initializing the project
Run `amplify init` to initialize the Amplify in your project.

You can either define your variables or use the default values that are proposed to you in parentheses. 

```bash
msalihg@ amplify_grocery_list % amplify init
Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory
? Enter a name for the project amplifygrocerylist
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: amplifygrocerylist
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: flutter
| Configuration file location: ./lib/

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use salihgueler-frankfurt
Adding backend environment dev to AWS Amplify app:

✔ Help improve Amplify CLI by sharing non sensitive configurations on failures (y/N) · no
Deployment state saved successfully.
✔ Initialized provider successfully.
✅ Initialized your environment successfully.

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!
```

### Amplify Libraries

AWS Amplify has many libraries that giving access to AWS technologies to the front-end, web and mobile developers. 

For Flutter the support is like the following:

Mobile, Web and Desktop on Developer Preview
- Analytics 
- Authentication
- GraphQL API 
- REST API 
- Storage

Stable version supports all the above in addition to the below library:
- Datastore (Mobile only for now)

### Adding Libraries to the Project

For adding the Amplify libraries first we will add them and push them to the cloud. You can use the default ones that are provided to you.

#### Adding Authentication

Run `amplify add auth` to add Authentication support. Follow the guide to take you through the setup:

```bash
msalihg@ amplify_grocery_list % amplify add auth
Using service: Cognito, provided by: awscloudformation
 
 The current configured provider is Amazon Cognito. 
 
 Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
 Warning: you will not be able to edit these selections. 
 How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
 Do you want to configure advanced settings? No, I am done.
 
✅ Successfully added auth resource locally
```

#### Adding GraphQL API
Run `amplify add api` to add GraphQL API support. Follow the guide to take you through the setup:

```bash
msalihg@ amplify_grocery_list % amplify add api
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: GraphQL
? Here is the GraphQL API that we will create. Select a setting to edit or continue Authorization modes: API key (d
efault, expiration time: 7 days from now)
? Choose the default authorization type for the API Amazon Cognito User Pool
Use a Cognito user pool configured as a part of this project.
? Configure additional auth types? No
? Here is the GraphQL API that we will create. Select a setting to edit or continue Continue
? Choose a schema template: Single object with fields (e.g., “Todo” with ID, name, description)

⚠️  WARNING: Some types do not have authorization rules configured. That means all create, read, update, and delete operations are denied on these types:
	 - Todo
Learn more about "@auth" authorization rules here: https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/authorization-rules
✅ GraphQL schema compiled successfully.

✅ Successfully added resource amplifygrocerylist locally
```

Afterwards, go to _amplify/backend/api/<name-of-the-app>/schema.graphql_ and update the file as follows:

```graphql
type Grocery @model @auth(rules: [{allow: owner}]) {
  id: ID!
  groceryItems: [GroceryItem!]! @hasMany(indexName: "byGrocery", fields: ["id"])
  title: String
  fileKey: String
  finalizationDate: AWSDate
  totalAmount: Float
}

type GroceryItem @model @auth(rules: [{allow: owner}]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  count: Int!
  amount: Float!
  groceryID: ID! @index(name: "byGrocery")
} 
```

Lastly run, `amplify codegen models` to generate the models for the GraphQL API.
#### Adding Storage
Run `amplify add storage` to add Amazon S3 support. Follow the guide to take you through the setup:

```bash
msalihg@bcd074760e20 amplify_grocery_list % amplify add storage
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)
✔ Provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project: · <resource>
✔ Provide bucket name: · <bucket-name>
✔ Who should have access: · Auth and guest users
✔ What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? · create/update, read, delete
✔ What kind of access do you want for Guest users? · create/update, read, delete
✔ Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket? (y/N) · no
⚠️ Auth configuration is required to allow unauthenticated users, but it is not configured properly.
✅ Successfully updated auth resource locally.
✅ Successfully added resource locally
```

#### Pushing to the cloud

Run `amplify push --yes` to push your changes to the cloud.
